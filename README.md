# Flask-Apps 🚀

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is a collection of small Flask web apps I made while learning Flask and Python. These are mostly to-do list kind of apps, made for practice and learning.  
If you’re a beginner like me, you might find these helpful.

You need to have Python installed first. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo:

2. Go into any app folder you want to run. Example:

cd "TODO_APP (Bootstrap + Deployed)"
```

3. Create a virtual environment:

```

4. Activate it:

- Windows:

## Why I made this 🧠

I was learning Flask and wanted to make something useful. So I made basic to-do apps with simple features like:

- Add tasks 📝  
- Update them ✏️  
- Delete them ❌  
- Use Bootstrap or CSS for styling 🎨  

It helped me understand how Flask works with HTML, forms, and databases.

---

## Stuff I used 📚

- **Flask** - web framework (Python)
- **SQLAlchemy** - to talk to the database (SQLite)
- **HTML/CSS** - basic frontend
- **Bootstrap** - for one of the app’s UI

---

## Can I use this?

Of course! Just clone it, change what you want, and go crazy. If you make something cool out of it, send it to me 😄
